* `--output`/`-o` output folder
* `--files`/`-f` list of output files separated by commas (and without `.gz`); `text` and `url` are always written, while `mime` and `html` are optional
* `--url-filters` file containing regular expressions that match urls of documents to eliminate
* `--verbose`/`-v` print progress and filtering information

  URL Filter format is a single regular expression per line.

  Lines beginning with `#` and empty lines are ignored. Any invalid filter will raise a warning message, but will not prevent other filters from being read.
